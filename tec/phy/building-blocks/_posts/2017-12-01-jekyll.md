Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.

Any file that contains a YAML front matter block will be processed by Jekyll as a special file. The front matter must be the first thing in the file and must take the form of valid YAML set between triple-dashed lines.

Blogging is baked into Jekyll. You write blog posts as text files and Jekyll provides everything you need to turn it into a blog.

https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/

The _posts folder is where your blog posts live. You typically write posts in Markdown, HTML is also supported.

To create a post, add a file to your _posts directory with the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

In addition to any collections you create yourself, the posts collection is hard-coded into Jekyll. It exists whether you have a _posts directory or not.


The index of _posts uses the collection as per category.
@see https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/


In the production environment some things behave different from e.g. development: For example a domain name will be used in production only, and localhost in development.
